# Mastermind

Mastermind is a classic puzzle game. The goal is to guess a hidden color code. Your opponent (the computer) creates a combination of four colors and hides it. Your challenge is to guess this color code by trying out different color combinations.

After you place your color tiles on the board, click the 'Check' button. A black or white dot will then appear to the right of your choices.

- Black dot: correct color and correct position
- White dot: correct color, wrong position

Place your color tiles by clicking them. To remove a color tile, simply click on it again.
